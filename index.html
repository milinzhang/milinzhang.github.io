<br>Hi, I am Milin Zhang (张 敉霖), a 3rd-year PhD Candidate at Northeastern University, working in the <a
	href="https://wiot.northeastern.edu/">Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://mentislab.info/">Francesco Restuccia</a>. I received my M.S. in electrical engineering at <a 
	href="https://www.syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a> in 2021. I received B.S. at <a 
	href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a> in 2018.
<br><br>I'm currently focusing on resilient and thrust-worthy AI/ML in resource constrained scenarios such as mobile edge computing. In addition, I work on AI-enpowered wireless communication/networking such as spectrum sensing and integreted sensing and communication for next-generation wireless technologies.

<br><br><b> I'm openning for research internship in summer 2025. </b>
