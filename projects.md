        <h2>Dynamic Defense to Adversarial RFMLS</h2>
        <p>Adversarial attack is a critical threat in Radio Frequency Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS). However, current state-of-the-art static defense sacrifice the performance on benign input, which cannot meet the QoS requirement of the communication system. In contrast, we propose a novel dynamic defense that can effectively improve the system's robustness without lossing performance on benign input.</p>

        <h2>Resilience of Entropy Model in Split Computing</h2>
        <p>Neural data compression has been applied to split computing to reduce the communication overhead. However, the robustness of this learning-driven compression remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigated how noise and interference in the input can increase the size of compressed data, hence introduces latency to split computing.</p>

        <h2>AdvML in Split Computing</h2>
        <p> Split computing can accelerate DNN applications by distributing the large model across mobile and edge devices. However, this can also expose the intermediate output to attackers. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the robustness in the intermediate output space with theory and experiment.</p>

        <h2>Cross-Layer Spectrum Sensing</h2>
        <p>Spectrum sensing has long been investigated in both the analog and digital domains. While incorporating technologies across these domains can boost its development, it requires a comprehensive knowledge spanning from the RF frontend to digital signal processing. We present the first effort to combine an on-chip analog spectrum sensor with learning-driven spectrum segmentation to achieve rapid and accurate sensing in the Sub-6 GHz bandwidth.</p>

        <h2>Wideband Semantic Spectrum Segmentation</h2>
        <p>Existing learning-driven spectrum sensing has two major challenges: 1) the bulky neural network requires a large computation capacity which is difficult to scale up to larger bandwidth; 2) the algorithm heavily relies on the training data which can barely generalize to complex spectrum conditions. We present a novel framework, a.k.a "semantic spectrum segmentation" to tackle these challenges. </p>
